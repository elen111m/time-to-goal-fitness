# Time-to-Goal Fitness

Time-to-Goal Fitness is a portfolio demo that predicts the number of days required to reach a target weight using machine learning. Built with Flask, SQLite, and a structured service/blueprint architecture, it demonstrates a full end-to-end data science pipeline: synthetic data generation, model training, REST APIs, and interactive UI with visualizations.

The system integrates multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and serves results through clean APIs and a lightweight web interface. Charts (Chart.js + Matplotlib/Seaborn) provide progress tracking and population-level insights.
